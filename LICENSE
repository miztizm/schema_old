Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person who has somehow stumbled upon this digital utopia (the "Schemer") to take part in the grand experiment known as the "Software" (because who doesn't love a good euphemism for code that may or may not work as intended). This includes the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software (assuming anyone actually wants to buy it). You may also let others partake in this digital escapade, provided they agree to the following terms, which are about as binding as a pinky promise.

The above copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. We insist on this because, let's face it, who doesn't love a bit of legalese sprinkled into their code? It's the digital equivalent of a secret handshake.

Now, for the fine print that nobody reads but everyone agrees to: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. In other words, if the Software crashes and burns, takes your computer with it, or accidentally launches a satellite into space, don't come crying to us. We're just here to provide the digital duct tape; it's up to you to figure out how to use it without getting stuck.

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software. So, if you decide to build a skyscraper on top of our code and it collapses, that's on you. We warned you it was "AS IS".

By using this Software, you agree to be part of the Schema movement, a grand experiment in digital anarchy and creativity. We hope you enjoy your stay in this digital wonderland, but if you don't, well, there's always the door. Just remember, you've been warned: this is a world of code, chaos, and questionable decisions. Proceed at your own risk.

Welcome to Schema. Good luck, and may the digital gods have mercy on your soul.
